            Mudumalai National Park is a part of the Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, located at a distance of 150
            kilometres from Coimbatore, in the Nilgiri District of Tamilnadu. It connects the Western Ghats to
            the Eastern Ghats and owes its popularity to the fact that it‚Äôs home to many vulnerable and
            endangered animal and bird species.<br><br>

            The neighbouring states of Kerala and Karnataka both have their borders adjacent to the park. The
            Ooty-Mysore highway passes through the forest, curving around the Moyar river which separates
            Mudumalai and the Bandipur National Park. Mudumalai is presently being considered for declaration as
            a world heritage site by UNESCO. The 6,000 square kilometre area under consideration comprises of
            the Western Ghats in Nilgiri, encompassing all of Mudumalai National Park.<br><br>

            Mudumalai is best known for its beautiful landscape of the blue skies complimenting the Nilgiri
            Hills owning the similar tint and surrounding hills and the Mudumalai National Park, which houses
            many species of animals and birds. Bird watching is an interesting activity here as fine bird
            specimens flock this area quite often.
