            <h1 class="special-animal-heading">Meet the famous Elephants of Mudumalai National Park</h1>

            <p class="special-animal-desc">Theppekadu‚Äôs most infamous resident was Loki, a notorious crop-raiding
                elephant named after the Norse god
                of mischief. Loki was captured in the forests of Padanthurai in 1997 and brought to the camp in
                September 1999. Loki was renamed Murthy after well-known veterinarian Dr Vaidyanathan Krishnamurthy.<br>

                Crop raiders have a different feeding pattern. They eat 100-150 kg of fodder through the night in one
                go. Loki‚Äôs bravado grew with his appetite. He attacked farmers protecting their crops and was
                responsible for 22 registered deaths across two states. Eventually, at the ripe age of 35, he was taken
                captive by the Forest Department.<br><br> It took four massive tuskers, tranquilisers and tons of chains
                to capture him and a year to break him in. Normally, a man-killer is terminated but for the first time
                in the history of Indian wildlife, a wild elephant was made to change his ways. Often, they use a kumki
                or trained elephant to trap wild ones. The legend of Loki took an ironic twist when he retired from
                kumki services last year quite honourably as ‚ÄòMakhana Murthy‚Äô!<br><br>

                Mudumalai is a mine of stories, attracting several researchers, scientists and filmmakers. Elephant
                woman Katherine ‚ÄòKaty‚Äô Payne who spent nearly 15 years researching African elephants, also spent some
                time at Theppakadu. <br><br>Hailed as the first person to prove that elephants communicate through
                sub-sonic sound (14 Hz), her path-breaking discovery busted the old myth that elephants use telepathy.
                She recorded over 1,000 different calls and identified the meaning of 400 calls.</p>

            Mudumalai National Park is a part of the Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, located at a distance of 150
            kilometres from Coimbatore, in the Nilgiri District of Tamilnadu. It connects the Western Ghats to
            the Eastern Ghats and owes its popularity to the fact that it‚Äôs home to many vulnerable and
            endangered animal and bird species.<br><br>

            The neighbouring states of Kerala and Karnataka both have their borders adjacent to the park. The
            Ooty-Mysore highway passes through the forest, curving around the Moyar river which separates
            Mudumalai and the Bandipur National Park. Mudumalai is presently being considered for declaration as
            a world heritage site by UNESCO. The 6,000 square kilometre area under consideration comprises of
            the Western Ghats in Nilgiri, encompassing all of Mudumalai National Park.<br><br>

            Mudumalai is best known for its beautiful landscape of the blue skies complimenting the Nilgiri
            Hills owning the similar tint and surrounding hills and the Mudumalai National Park, which houses
            many species of animals and birds. Bird watching is an interesting activity here as fine bird
            specimens flock this area quite often.
