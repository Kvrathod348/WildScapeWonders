            <h1>Meet the famous elephants of Mudumalai National Park</h1>

            <p>Theppekadu‚Äôs most infamous resident was Loki, a notorious crop-raiding elephant named after the Norse god of mischief. Loki was captured in the forests of Padanthurai in 1997 and brought to the camp in September 1999. Loki was renamed Murthy after well-known veterinarian Dr Vaidyanathan Krishnamurthy.<br>

                Crop raiders have a different feeding pattern. They eat 100-150 kg of fodder through the night in one go. Loki‚Äôs bravado grew with his appetite. He attacked farmers protecting their crops and was responsible for 22 registered deaths across two states. Eventually, at the ripe age of 35, he was taken captive by the Forest Department.<br><br> It took four massive tuskers, tranquilisers and tons of chains to capture him and a year to break him in. Normally, a man-killer is terminated but for the first time in the history of Indian wildlife, a wild elephant was made to change his ways. Often, they use a kumki or trained elephant to trap wild ones. The legend of Loki took an ironic twist when he retired from kumki services last year quite honourably as ‚ÄòMakhana Murthy‚Äô!<br><br>
                
                Mudumalai is a mine of stories, attracting several researchers, scientists and filmmakers. Elephant woman Katherine ‚ÄòKaty‚Äô Payne who spent nearly 15 years researching African elephants, also spent some time at Theppakadu. <br><br>Hailed as the first person to prove that elephants communicate through sub-sonic sound (14 Hz), her path-breaking discovery busted the old myth that elephants use telepathy. She recorded over 1,000 different calls and identified the meaning of 400 calls.</p>

                    The very best of the wilder side of Tamil Nadu, yet one of the most picturesque and sought-after ones too; it‚Äôs where Nature thrives and the majestic beasts 
            of the jungles roam around freely. Mudumalai National Park is indeed a world in itself.<br><br>
            In the context of a fast-deteriorating world ecological order, it is more than important to protect and preserve our forests. They are the last remaining lifelines for both mankind and other species on Earth. Mudumalai National Park loudly announces this 
            message to the world and sets itself as a precious example to follow. The Park is a wildlife sanctuary and is home to a wide variety of protected flora and fauna.<br> <br>
            
            Primarily nestled in the western side of Tamil Nadu, the national park shares borders with the states of Kerala and Karnataka. A part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the sanctuary is crusted with other national parks including Bandipur, Nagarhole, Wayanad, 
            Mukurthi and Silent Valley national parks. These parks and reserve forests together are spread across a whopping area of 3300 sq.km of forest land. <br><br>
            
            Mudumalai is home to 55 species of mammals, 227 species of birds, 50 species of fishes, 21 species of amphibians and 34 species of reptiles. This includes many endangered species of animals including elephants, tigers, gaur and Indian Leopards. Around 8% of the total
             bird species in India can be found in the region. When it comes to the flora of Mudumalai, you will come across a rich diversity of rare plants and trees that add to the natural charm and ecological balance of the park. <br><br>
            
            With plenty of scenic spots, adventurous safaris and nature camps, the Mudumalai National Park is a visitor‚Äôs paradise. Whether visiting alone, with family or with friends, Mudumalai is a must-visit destination on your trip to Tamil Nadu.
