                conservation achievement.
                Kaziranga National Park was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1985 for its large population of
                one-horned rhino, tigers, elephants, panthers, bears and many birds, and its representation of the

            <h3>one-horned Rhinoceros</h3>
            Kaziranga National Park famous for its one-horned Rhinoceros is located in Golaghat, Nagaon and Sonitpur
            districts of Assam. Kaziranga was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985. The park has an area
            of some 430 square km and lies between the Brahmaputra River and the Karbi (Mikir) Hills.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                he Kaziranga Proposed Reserve Forest was created with an area of 232 square km on 1st June 1905 and with
                the enactment of Assam National Park Act of 1968 it was declared as the National Park. It is a protected
                area that is rich in natural beauty and diversity of flora and fauna. Apart from one-horned rhinoceros
                with a population of 2613 dated March, 2022, the park is the breeding ground of elephants, wild water
                buffalo, and swamp deer.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Over the time, the tiger population has also increased in Kaziranga, and that‚Äôs the reason why Kaziranga
                was declared as Tiger Reserve in 2006. Birds like lesser white-fronted goose, ferruginous duck, Baer‚Äôs
                pochard duck and lesser adjutant, greater adjutant, black-necked stork, and Asian Openbill stork
                specially migrate from the Central Asia during the winter season.

                quench their thirst. This river is the secondary source for them since, during the summer season, the
                Ramganga River dries up. Besides river rafting, Kosi River is a famous spot for adventure activities
                like river crossing, fishing, & bird watching.

                you spot multiple birds & animals like wild boar, elephants, deer, jackals, or, if lucky, can also spot
                tigers or leopards roaming across.
